        <p><b>Version: 1</b></p>

        <p>
            To be able to uniquely identify, and to authenticate users, Shuck stores
            the Google id numbers of users who have logged in with their Google account.
            This is used to store the user's rating and their chosen nickname. This information
            is fetched when logging in in the game's menu.
        </p>


        <table frame="box">
            <tr align="left">
                <th>Google id</th>
                <th>Nickname</th>
                <th>Rating</th>
                <th>Deviation</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>123456789</td>
                <td>Grandmaster</td>
                <td>3000</td>
                <td>50</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            The nicknames and ratings of the top 10 players are displayed in a public leaderboard.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is currently no way for a user to delete this information within the app. However,
            the ratings table, including the user's id and choosen nickname, is routinely cleared.

            Requests for clearing this data can be sent to arbanoapp@gmail.com.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shuck does not send any information to a third party, or collect statistics.
